# Responsive Layout for Home Office Setup

This project demonstrates a simple responsive layout using HTML and CSS. It is designed to showcase a basic home office setup consisting of three elements: a desk, a computer, and a plant. The layout adjusts based on the screen size, starting with a mobile-first approach.

## Features
- **Mobile-First Design**: The layout is optimized for mobile devices by default.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries are used to adjust the layout for larger screens, ensuring a visually appealing experience on desktops or tablets.
- **Elements**:
  - Desk
  - Computer
  - Plant

## Files
- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the layout.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS for styling the elements and making the layout responsive.

## How It Works
1. On smaller screens (default view), the elements take up 100% width, stacked vertically.
2. For screens wider than 400px, the elements are displayed side-by-side, each taking up 30% of the width with a small margin between them.

## Usage
Simply open `index.html` in your browser to see the responsive layout in action.
